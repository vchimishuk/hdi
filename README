README
    hdi is HDD idle daemon.
    It is used to put HDD into standby mode in case of inactivity. Similar
    functionality is provided by `hdparm -S` and hd-idle. `hdparm -S` and
    hd-idle do not work with some HDDs especially connected via USB.
    hdi is designed specifically for such cases.

INSTALL
    As a regular Go program, you can install it with `go get` and manage
    service by yourself.
    go get github.com/vchimishuk/hdi

    But the best way is to build Debian package and use systemd to manage
    hdi daemon.

    See /etc/hdi.conf file for more details about hdi configuration.
